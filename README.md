# Real-World-Prototype-Codes

This repository contains prototype codes that demonstrate how Arduino Opta PLC, Raspberry Pi, and Blockchain can work together in real-world IoT and supply chain contexts.
The focus is on reliable data collection, secure communication (via Modbus TCP), and blockchain anchoring of sensor data for tamper-proof Digital Product Passports (DPP).

# Code Walkthrough
### 1. Arduino Opta (Modbus Client â€“ .ino)

This sketch configures the Arduino Opta PLC to act as a Modbus TCP client. It communicates with a Raspberry Pi acting as a Modbus server.

Uses the ArduinoModbus and Ethernet libraries in Aeduino IDE.

Establishes static IPs for both Opta (192.168.60.2) and Pi (192.168.60.1).<br><br>

Polls three Modbus Holding Registers every second:

HR0: sensor voltage (mV â†’ V)

HR1: sensor resistance Rs (kÎ©)

HR2: normalized Rs/R0 ratio

It avoids small fluctuations by applying threshold filters (EPS).
Only significant changes trigger new serial output, reducing spam.

#### Key Outcome: The PLC continuously monitors sensor values sent from the Raspberry Pi and can later use them to drive actuators or alarms.<br><br>
### 2. Raspberry Pi (Sensor + Blockchain â€“ sensor_blockchain.py)

The Python script demonstrates the data acquisition and blockchain anchoring pipeline:

- Sensor Interface

- Reads analog signals from an MQ gas sensor using an ADS1115 ADC via IÂ²C.

- Performs calibration in clean air to determine baseline R0.

- Computes Rs and the ratio Rs/R0.

- Emission Data XML

Formats sensor readings into an XML payload:
```xml
<EmissionData>
  <DeviceID>MQ_01</DeviceID>
  <Timestamp>2025-08-17T10:00:00Z</Timestamp>
  <GasType>CO2</GasType>
  <Voltage unit="V">0.542</Voltage>
  <SensorResistance unit="ohm">9,800</SensorResistance>
  <RsOverR0>1.235</RsOverR0>
  <Location>Warehouse_A</Location>
</EmissionData>
```

#### Saves the payload as a timestamped .xml file in ~/dpp_samples/.

### Blockchain Integration

Hashes the XML payload using SHA-256.

Anchors the hash to an Ethereum in-memory blockchain (EthereumTester).

Stores the proof of immutability on-chain, along with transaction details (TX hash, block number).

#### Key Outcome: The Pi acts as both a sensor gateway and a blockchain anchor node, bridging the physical and digital layers.<br><br>

### 3. PLC Codes (.plcproj)

A separate PLC-IDE/ folder will later include IEC 61131-3 compliant PLC projects (.plcproj) created with the Arduino PLC IDE, showcasing ladder logic or structured text versions of the same workflow.

# ðŸ”— End-to-End Flow

1. Raspberry Pi reads COâ‚‚ sensor â†’ converts values â†’ builds XML.

2. Raspberry Pi anchors XML hash on blockchain â†’ proof of immutability.

3. Arduino Opta PLC connects to Pi via Modbus TCP â†’ polls sensor values in real time.

4. PLC can use these values for decision-making (e.g., trigger ventilation, alarms, or actuators).

5. This creates a verifiable chain of trust:

#### Physical Layer (sensor) â†’ Digital Layer (XML + blockchain) â†’ Control Layer (PLC).

# ðŸš€ Getting Started
